## Installation
```javascript
npm install nodeactyl
```


## What am i?

Nodeactyl is an API For NodeJS to communicated with the Pterodactyl Panel, you can control ANY server on your nodes with it (If you purchase a server from another host, no worry! The API works with your own server too!) . Thie library's original intent was to be for discord bots, but since this is in NodeJS, it is usable in ANY type of NodeJS program (Socket.IO, Electron, Express and more!).

## How do i work?
This API works by using the Pterodactyl API (REST requests) to the Server/Node, by gathering the Panel website, Account/Application API and a server/node ID. This library depends on Axios, a promise basid HTTP/HTTPS request system, this is how Nodectyl is able to send curl commands to pterodactyl. The API itself is VERY simple and I am extremely suprised that no one has even tried making one (There are probably private ones, but none are avaliable to the public).


## Documentation
In the past we kept our documentation on our main README.md, we have no moved to `https://app.gitbook.com/@nodeactyl/s/docs/v/v2.0.0-english/` (Big thanks to @Elliot for taking care of the documentation for Nodeactyl!)

## Disclaimer
We (The Nodeactyl team) Are not responsible for any damages that you cause to your Server/Node by using this API. Remember: This API can do ANYTHING (Delete Servers/Nodes at an instant is extremely easy!). It is **NOT** our fault that you let your API key be public. When asking for help do **NOT** send a full stack error. This will reveal your ENTIRE Host/Application API key in the REST Error, If someone asks you "Let me see the error" It should only be trusted sources! (Such as the Pterodactyl Team/Nodeactyl Team). You should also have your API key changed every 1-3 days to prevent issues like this.
